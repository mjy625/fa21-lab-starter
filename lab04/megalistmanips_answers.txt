1.to get the address of an array in a node, you should dereference the pointer of the address of node
2. to access the next element in the array, we should let the offset be 4 rather than 1
3. before we call a function, we should save temp register (caller saved) and ra if we need to use their current value after calling
4. to get address of next node, we need just copy the next field of current node, rather than use 'la' instruction
5. to call map, we need have a1 the address of function, not the data in that address
6. after whole function, we need to return the address stroed in ra
